    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The Beef Manhattan is a roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy
      that originated in Indianapolis in the late 1940s. The dish is named after
      workers at the Naval Ordnance Plant (NOPI) who were trained in Manhattan
      during World War II and enjoyed an open-faced sandwich there. They then
      brought the sandwich back to the factory cafeteria, where it became known
      as the Beef Manhattan.
